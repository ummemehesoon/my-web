<h1>Learn to Deal with People Using <br />Pantherena’s Tricks</h1>

<p><strong>Written on:</strong> May 17, 2025<br />
<strong>By:</strong> Umme</p>

<h2>About the Writer</h2>
<p>I’m Umme, a 9th-grade student at Milestone School. I’ve always been curious about how the human mind works. That curiosity led me to explore many books about the human brain, psychology, and how people behave. I’m also deeply interested in the laws of domination — how great leaders have influenced and dominated others. I wanted to learn how to deal with people in a way that brings great results.</p>

<p>I started learning about these topics in December 2023. At first, I didn’t read physical books — I only listened to audio versions online, and not regularly. But one day, I saw my elder brother holding a physical copy of <em>The 48 Laws of Power</em> — a book I had already listened to. I was shocked because I thought no one around me was interested in these kinds of books. After that, my brother started buying more books about human nature, power, and domination.</p>

<p>From then on, I also began reading physical books — not regularly at first, but gradually more often.</p>

<p>And trust me — if you really want to apply the knowledge from books into your real life, you should read them manually. When you read a physical book, your brain is more likely to store that information deeply. Later, when you make a decision or say something, your mind automatically filters it through the knowledge you've gained. Since then, I’ve started applying the strategies I’ve learned when dealing with people.</p>

<p>One day, while lying on my bed, an idea suddenly came to my mind — I should write down all the thoughts and ideas I’ve collected from these books. After exploring so many of them, my brain naturally follows certain psychological patterns and decision-making algorithms. I decided to gather all of these insights into a simple book. This way, even if I forget something later, I can go back to my own book and refresh my mind.</p>

<p>Also, I know that people like me often feel too lazy to read thick, heavy books. That’s why I started writing a short, straightforward book with the most basic but powerful psychological laws. And here is the ultimate result!</p>

<hr />

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decision Taking:</strong> (How you want to lead your life?)<br />
    I) A person who just makes a decision, says something to someone, and then regrets later<br />
    II) A person who never makes wrong decisions and never regrets later
  </li>
  <li><strong>Understanding People:</strong> (How you want that people should know you or in which view you want people can see you?)<br />
    I) A person who is known as a public book that can be read by any human reader<br />
    II) The human reader!
  </li>
  <li><strong>Treating People:</strong> (How you wanna treat those you don't like?)<br />
    I) A public killer which gonna have a short-time effect<br />
    II) A silent killer which can have a long-time effect, even it can have a lifetime effect also!
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Chapter 1: Decision Taking</h2>
<p><strong>I)</strong> If you say or took a decision what gives you a dopamine for the current moment. But the thing you said, or the decision you take... if you do it without even thinking for a minute, there's a high chance you'll say the wrong thing or make the wrong decision — and regret it later.</p>
<blockquote>[It usually happens when people are angry or too much excited]</blockquote>

<p><strong>II)</strong> If a person takes time to think about what he is going to say or which decision he is going to take, and after seeing or taking a decision what going to be happen. If anyone can think like that, there is a high chance that he will never say something wrong or never going to take any wrong decision. That means there is no chance of regret later.</p>
<blockquote>[Calm-minded people always think before saying something.]</blockquote>

<div class="example">
  <strong>Example:</strong> if you are speaking in public while holding a high political position and you say something wrong, can you even imagine what a disaster it could cause?
</div>

<hr />

<h2>Chapter 2: Understanding People</h2>
<p><strong>I)</strong> If you want to be like a public book, it means anyone can easily understand you — your emotions, ideas, life plans, and everything about you. Even if a human reader talks with you, they can clearly sense how you think, what types of thoughts you have, what your next steps might be, and many other things about you.</p>
<blockquote>[It usually shows you’re an open-minded person, who trusts people easily]</blockquote>

<p><strong>II)</strong> If you want to be a true observer of people — a human reader — you must become someone who remains a mystery. Keep your own thoughts and feelings private so that no one truly knows much about you. At the same time, you must develop the ability to understand others deeply — to sense what they’re thinking just by talking to them. To gain this ability, you need to follow certain rules and master a few key techniques.</p>
<blockquote>[To be a human reader, the rules you have to follow or the techniques you need to practice may sometimes feel hard and difficult.]</blockquote>

<div class="example">
  <strong>Example:</strong> If you're an open book, you express your true emotions — and people can use them against you.<br />
  But if you're the reader, you understand others deeply while staying unreadable yourself — they can't judge what they can't see.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>Chapter 3: Treating People</h2>
<p><strong>Dealing with those you don’t like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>I)</strong> If you choose to be a public killer, it means you act openly — your hatred is visible, and everyone knows who you’re against. Every step you take is seen and judged. If you go too far, people will question your actions, and the person you target may strike back, knowing you’re their enemy. They can also take actions against you to protect themselves.</p>
<p><em>(It can have a short-term effect.)</em></p>

<p><strong>II)</strong> If you choose to be a silent killer, it means the person doesn’t even know you hate them. That means they can’t take any action against you. Since they are unaware, you can become their friend, earn their trust, and know their weaknesses — which you can use against them when it’s needed.</p>
<p><em>(It can have a long-term effect.)</em></p>

<div class="example">
  <strong>Example:</strong> If you act like a public killer, everyone can see your hatred, and your enemy prepares to fight back. It’s risky. But if you choose to be a silent killer, you hide your hatred, gain trust, and strike when they don’t expect it.
</div>

<h2>The Principle Laws of All Chapters</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>If you want to be someone who never makes wrong decisions, then this is the law you must follow:</strong><br />
  Always think before you speak or act! Your words and actions shape your future.</li>
  <li><strong>If you want to be a human reader, then this is the law you must follow:</strong><br />
  Stay mysterious! The less you reveal, the more you observe. People show their true selves when you're silent.</li>
  <li><strong>If you want to be a silent killer, then the law you must follow is:</strong><br />
  Kind eyes, quiet mind, unseen moves! Let your charm distract them, while your mind stays five steps ahead.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Some Extra Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Not Every Fight Is Worth Fighting</strong><br />
  Never make enemies of those who hold more power than you. Preserve your energy for battles you can win.</li>
  <li><strong>Master the Silent Defense</strong><br />
  When words fail or aren’t safe to use, wear a calm smile and act unaffected. Silence often speaks louder than arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Exit Conversations Gracefully</strong><br />
  If you don’t want to continue a topic, respond with what the other person wants to hear—and move on.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Your Tongue in Anger</strong><br />
  Never speak when you’re angry. Words said in anger often become regrets.</li>
  <li><strong>Think Before Every Decision</strong><br />
  No matter how small the decision, take a moment to think it through. Haste often leads to mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Be Generous with Compliments</strong><br />
  When asked for an opinion—about anyone or anything—offer something positive. A kind word costs nothing and earns much.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t Argue If You Can’t Win</strong><br />
  If you lack the strength or position to win a fight, avoid the argument altogether. Walking away can be wiser than confronting.</li>
  <li><strong>Test Trust with Harmless Secrets</strong><br />
  Share a light, non-serious secret with a group and ask them to keep it private. If it spreads, you’ll know who not to trust—without risking anything valuable.</li>
  <li><strong>Think More, Speak Less</strong><br />
  Let your mind guide your actions, not your mouth. Thoughtful silence is more powerful than reckless speech.</li>
  <li><strong>Play Innocent to Insults</strong><br />
  If someone tries to mock or belittle you, act like you don’t understand. Nothing disarms mockery like indifference.</li>
</ol>
